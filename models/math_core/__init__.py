"""Exact mathematical solvers — the ground-truth computation layer.

Every equation from the patent portfolio and clinical parameter schemas
is implemented here as a deterministic solver. The neural foundation model
is trained to approximate and generalize these solvers, not the other way
around. Math first, learning second.
